Understanding the Threat of Subdomain Hacking:

Subdomain hacking can be a serious threat to businesses and organizations that rely on their online presence. Attackers can use subdomain hacking to gain access to sensitive information, deface the website, or distribute malware.

Subdomain takeover is a common subdomain hacking technique where attackers take control of a subdomain by pointing it to their own server or IP address. This allows them to intercept and manipulate traffic intended for the legitimate subdomain, giving them access to sensitive data such as login credentials or customer information.

Another technique used in subdomain hacking is subdomain enumeration, where attackers use tools to scan a domain for subdomains that may have been overlooked or left unsecured. Attackers can use this information to launch further attacks, such as phishing or social engineering attacks.
