This Python code is a basic script for scanning open ports on a specified target IP address using socket connections. It prints out information about the open ports it discovers. Here's a breakdown of what the code does:

1. Importing Required Modules:
   - The code starts by importing the `socket` module, which provides low-level network communication capabilities.
   - It also imports the `datetime` module to work with date and time-related operations.

2. Defining the Target IP Address:
   - The IP address "192.168.1.3"(and this ip address is metasploitable2 machine's current ip address so each and every time we have to check the ip address while starting the metasploitable2 machine.) is assigned to the variable named `target`. This is the IP address that will be scanned for open ports.

3. Printing Information:
   - A series of print statements are used to display messages indicating the scanning process's progress.
   - A line of dashes is printed to serve as a visual separator.
   - The target IP address and the current date and time are printed to indicate the scanning target and the start time of the scan.
   - Another line of dashes is printed.

4. Scanning for Open Ports:
   - The code uses a `for` loop to iterate through a range of port numbers, specifically from 19 to 80.
   - Within each iteration of the loop, a socket connection is established to the target IP address and the current port.
   - The `socket.socket` function is used to create a socket object with the address family `AF_INET` (IPv4) and the socket type `SOCK_STREAM` (TCP).
   - The `socket.setdefaulttimeout(1)` function sets a timeout of 1 second for socket operations. This means that if the connection attempt takes longer than 1 second, it will be considered unsuccessful.
   - The `s.connect_ex((target,port))` function is used to establish a connection to the target IP address and port. The result is stored in the `result` variable.
   - If `result` is equal to 0, it means the connection was successful, indicating an open port. In this case, the code prints a message indicating that the port is open.
   - The socket is then closed using the `s.close()` function.

5. Handling Exceptions:
   - The code includes several `except` blocks to handle potential exceptions that might occur during the execution of the scanning process.
   - If a `KeyboardInterrupt` (Ctrl+C) is detected, the program prints a message and exits.
   - If a `socket.gaierror` occurs (hostname resolution error), the program prints a message indicating that the hostname couldn't be resolved and exits.
   - If a generic `socket.error` occurs (unable to connect to the server), the program prints a message indicating the connection couldn't be established and exits.

The code essentially performs a basic port scanning operation on the specified target IP address for ports ranging from 19 to 80. It indicates which ports are open by printing their numbers. Keep in mind that this code has limitations and might not work accurately in all scenarios, especially in modern network environments with various security measures in place. It's recommended to use specialized tools and follow ethical guidelines when performing port scanning activities.
